                        Hi! I'm Reedik, Head of Services Management Department at Estonian 
                        Transport Administration. By education I am an architect (a real one,
                        not a system architect) and have actually practiced as one too during 
                        my studies and for a short period of time right after graduation.<br><br>
                        I have also worked as a service manager (parcel machines, courier services) 
                        and as a head of a team that managed financial and data services for 
                        Estonian Post. After a three-year run as the CEO of one of the biggest 
                        Estonian architecture offices (KOKO architects) I decided to return to 
                        financial services, this time around within a bank - Luminor. 
                        As of July 2022, I am running the Services Management Department within 
                        Estonian Transport Administration and it has been a blast: fast paced dive 
                        into the world of land, air and sea transport - all in the demanding sauce 
                        of public services.<br><br>                        
                        In my free time I like to keep myself busy with things I believe will help 
                        me stave off boredom - like studying HTML/CSS/JavaScript.<br><br>                  
                        Fun fact! I've been programming for <span id="timer"></span>
